        "Imagine we have a machine that identifies apples in a basket of mixed fruits. The task of the machine is: label each fruit as \"apple\" or \"not-apple\".\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Accuracy**:\n",
        "    - Definition: The proportion of all predictions that were correct.\n",
        "    - Example: If our machine looked at 100 fruits and correctly identified 90 of them (either as apples or not-apples), its accuracy is 90%.\n",
        "    - Think of it as the overall correctness of the machine.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Precision**:\n",
        "    - Definition: Of all the items labeled by the machine as \"apple,\" what proportion was actually apples?\n",
        "    - Simple Explanation: Suppose our machine pointed out 50 fruits as apples, but only 25 of them were real apples. The precision would be 25/50 or 50%.\n",
        "    - It tells us how \"precise\" our machine is when calling something an apple.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Recall** (also known as Sensitivity or True Positive Rate):\n",
        "    - Definition: Of all the real apples in the basket, what proportion did the machine correctly identify as apples?\n",
        "    - Simple Explanation: If there were 50 actual apples and our machine only identified 40 of them, then the recall is 40/50 or 80%.\n",
        "    - Recall answers the question: How many actual apples did we manage to recall/identify?\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **F1 Score**:\n",
        "    - Definition: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, giving a balance between the two.\n",
        "    - Simple Explanation: If our precision is 80% and our recall is also 80%, the F1 score is also 80%. But if either drops, the F1 score drops too. It's a single metric that tries to balance precision and recall.\n",
        "    - Consider it a balanced score: if either precision or recall is low, the F1 score will be low.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the apple example, let's say:\n",
        "- The machine points at 10 fruits saying \"these are apples!\"\n",
        "- In reality, only 8 of them are apples (so, precision = 8/10 = 80%).\n",
        "- But there were 20 apples in total, and the machine only identified 8 of them (so, recall = 8/20 = 40%).\n",
        "\n",
        "While precision is high, recall is low, which means the machine is good at being sure when it says something is an apple, but it's missing a lot of the actual apples. The F1 score would reflect this imbalance."
