Text generation models like Llama or Falcon (decoder-only) are good for use-cases that require generating longer, fluent texts, such as chat bots; text2text models like T5 (encoder-decoder) are better for use-cases that require analysing/understanding a text, such as classification or summarization. This notebook therefore uses a version of T5. You can test other models too. The principles are the same across models."
